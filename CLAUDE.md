## Overview

Sample of the x402 HTTP payment protocol (`@x402/*` ^2.23.0) as a pnpm workspace (`pkgs/*`). It targets **Arc Testnet** (`arcTestnet` from `viem/chains`, `eip155:5042002`, USDC), migrated from a Kaia Kairos/JPYC template that still leaves some stale values (see below). Serena memories in `.serena/memories/` (start at `core`) hold more detail.

## Commands

Run from the repo root. The packages are addressed through root scripts: `pnpm facilitator`, `pnpm x402server`, `pnpm x402client`, `pnpm x402mcp` (each is `pnpm --filter <pkg>`).

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm setup                     # copies pkgs/*/.env.example -> .env (fill in EVM_PRIVATE_KEY etc.)

pnpm facilitator run dev       # :4022  (tsx watch)
pnpm x402server run dev        # :4021  (tsx watch)
pnpm x402client run dev        # one-shot: requests PAYWALL_PATH, pays, prints result
pnpm x402client run approve [amount] [--execute]  # USDC allowance to Permit2 (upto budget); dry-run without --execute
pnpm x402client run guardrails # upto guardrail scenarios against a running facilitator + server

pnpm start / pnpm stop         # facilitator + server in background; PID/logs in .run/
pnpm check                     # biome check --write . (lint + format); pnpm format = format only
pnpm facilitator run build     # tsc -> dist/
pnpm x402mcp run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit for the MCP package (Node side)

# Cloudflare Workers (see docs/cloudflare-deploy.md)
pnpm cf:dev:facilitator        # wrangler dev :8788 (needs git-ignored pkgs/facilitator/.dev.vars)
pnpm cf:dev:server             # :8789
pnpm cf:dev:mcp                # :8790, MCP at /mcp
pnpm deploy:facilitator|server|mcp   # wrangler deploy (order: facilitator -> server -> mcp)
pnpm <pkg> run cf:typecheck    # wrangler types + tsc -p tsconfig.worker.json (facilitator/x402server/x402mcp)

curl localhost:4022/supported  # facilitator; also /health, POST /verify, POST /settle
curl localhost:4021/health
```

There is no test suite, and `client` has no type-check step (`tsx` only). `facilitator` has `build` and `cf:typecheck`, `mcp` has `typecheck` and `cf:typecheck`, `server` has `cf:typecheck` only. Start order matters: facilitator → server → client.

## Architecture

Four independent packages with no cross-imports; they communicate only over HTTP (or stdio for `mcp`):

1. **client** — `@x402/axios` wraps an axios instance. On a 402 response it signs a payment with a viem account (`EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`) and retries.
2. **server** — Hono app with `paymentMiddleware(x402Config, resourceServer)` gating `GET /weather`. Pricing/route config is `x402Config` in `pkgs/server/src/config.ts`. It never touches the chain itself: `HTTPFacilitatorClient` (`FACILITATOR_URL`) delegates verification and settlement.
3. **facilitator** — Hono app exposing `/verify`, `/settle`, `/supported`. It registers `exact` and `upto` (`UptoEvmScheme`) schemes on one chain, and settles on-chain through a viem wallet client wrapped by `toFacilitatorEvmSigner` (`src/viem.ts`). Lifecycle hooks (`onBefore*`, `onAfter*`, `on*Failure`) in `src/index.ts` log with `================ Stage ================` banners.

4. **mcp** (`pkgs/mcp`, `x402mcp`) — stdio MCP server so Claude Code can run the demo. Tools: `wallet_status`, `wallet_login_start`, `wallet_login_verify`, `set_budget` (two-step, `confirm`), `pay_and_fetch` (path allowlist). Wallets are Privy **user-owned**: email OTP login (`@privy-io/js-sdk-core`), wallet created with `owner = user`, and a per-user delegate key (P-256, generated locally, stored in `~/.x402mcp/wallet.json`, mode 0600) added as an additional signer with a Privy policy (`src/policy.ts`: ALLOW-only rules for upto/exact typed-data signatures within the cap and to allowed payees, plus `approve` transaction signing to the token only). Signing goes through Privy (`createViemAccount`); transactions are broadcast by our own RPC client. Never write to stdout (stdio is the protocol); log with `console.error`. Register with `claude mcp add x402-arc-demo -- pnpm --dir <repo>/pkgs/mcp exec tsx src/index.ts`. `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` must never be handed to workshop attendees. Status: type-checked and smoke-tested without credentials; the Privy login/wallet/policy flow is not yet verified against a real Privy app.

### Cloudflare Workers deployment

facilitator, server and mcp can also run on Cloudflare Workers. Each package has `src/index.ts` (Node / stdio) and `src/worker.ts` (Workers) sharing the same core: facilitator `app.ts` + `facilitator.ts`, server `app.ts`, mcp `tools.ts` with `store.ts` (KV-style store used in Workers) / `store.node.ts` (file store, `~/.x402mcp/wallet.json`). The mcp Worker is a Durable Object class `X402Mcp` (McpAgent) served at `/mcp`, with Origin check and rate limit (`guard.ts`). Config lives in each `wrangler.jsonc` (`vars` are public values; secrets `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` / `PRIVY_APP_SECRET` go through `wrangler secret put`, never in files). Deploy steps, pre-deploy checklist and operational caveats: `docs/cloudflare-deploy.md`.

### `upto` (usage-based) guardrails

Server route `GET /usage?units=N` uses the `upto` scheme: the client authorizes a maximum via a Permit2 signature (`USAGE_MAX_AMOUNT`), and the handler settles only `units × USAGE_UNIT_PRICE` through `setSettlementOverrides`. The handler deliberately does not clamp to the maximum, so over-cap settlement can be verified to fail. Two enforcement layers: the per-payment maximum in the Permit2 signature, and the total budget = the token's ERC-20 allowance to Permit2 (set with `approve`; never `maxUint256`). The client also caps signing itself via `createPaymentClient(maxAmountPerPayment)` (default 1 USDC, env `MAX_AMOUNT_PER_PAYMENT`). Gas-sponsoring extensions are not declared, so the client must hold the allowance and gas itself.

### Chain/asset config comes from env, interpreted in `pkgs/config`

Chain, token and prices are **not hardcoded**: each package reads them from its own `.env` (`vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` on Workers). `pkgs/config/src/index.ts` (workspace package `@x402-sample/config`, TS source consumed directly by tsx and wrangler) only holds the parsing: `getChain(env)` (`CHAIN_NAME` = a `viem/chains` export such as `arcTestnet`), `getChainId`, `getTokenAddress` (`ASSET_ADDRESS`), `getToken` (`TOKEN_NAME` / `TOKEN_VERSION` / `TOKEN_DECIMALS`), `getPricing` (`PRICE_WEATHER` / `USAGE_UNIT_PRICE` / `USAGE_MAX_AMOUNT` in token units, converted with decimals). They take any env-like object (`process.env` or the Workers `env`) and throw an error naming the missing/invalid keys, never the values. Which package needs which: server = all of them; facilitator = `CHAIN_NAME`; client and mcp = `CHAIN_NAME` + `ASSET_ADDRESS`. `MAX_AMOUNT_PER_PAYMENT` (client, mcp) and `MAX_BUDGET` (mcp) stay optional atomic-unit env vars with defaults. Switching chain/token therefore still means editing the same values in each package's `.env` and `wrangler.jsonc`, but there is no source edit. This is the one deliberate exception to "no cross-imports" between packages. `TOKEN_NAME`/`TOKEN_VERSION` must match the token's on-chain `name()`/`version()`: a wrong `version` makes the facilitator's verify revert with `FiatTokenV2: invalid signature`. Arc USDC is `name="USDC"`, `version="2"`, `decimals=6`; read these from the contract when changing token. `viem/chains` is imported as a namespace for the lookup, which adds it to every Worker bundle (about 325 KiB gzip for the facilitator, 340 KiB server, 1.2 MiB mcp). Some human-readable strings (MCP tool descriptions in `pkgs/mcp/src/lib/tools.ts`, comments in `guardrails.ts`) still mention "0.5 USDC" and are not generated from the config.

Stale leftovers: none of the old Kaia/JPYC values remain in `.env.example`.

## Conventions specific to this repo

- Source comments are in Japanese; match that when editing existing files.
- Route error responses use `c.json({ error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error" }, 500)`.
- `.env.example` files are denied to Serena's read tools; use the general `Read` tool.
- `.claude/rules/testing.md` describes test conventions, but no tests exist yet, so they are aspirational.
- Both package.json files pin different `pnpm` versions (root 10.32.1, packages 10.33.0); not yet unified.
